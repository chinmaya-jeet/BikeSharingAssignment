## General Information
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 
    
The objective of the project is to understand the factor that impact the bike rental demand in American market. This should analyze the variables like seasons, weather conditions and holidays etc to understand the impact. The insights expected from the analysis are

	1. Identify the various variables impacting (both positively and negatively) on the bike rentals.
	2. How these variables describe the impact i.e. quantification
	3. Help build strategies to increase the demand for bike rentals in American market  
    
## Conclusions
Below is th insight we can get from the above analysis. This analysis shows the impact of various conditions on the bike sharing. As per th analysis the bike rental demand is highly sensitive to temporal and weather considitions.

1.Windy situations: Whenever there is increase in the wind speed, that decreases the demand for bike rental due to adverse conditions for biking. High winds can make cycling more challenging and less safe, which likely discourages users from renting bikes.

2. Weather conditions: The weather conditions has impact on the bike rental. The demand for bike rental goes down during bad weather conditions such as rain or extreme cold weather. 

3. Holiday impact: During holidays the bike rentals seems to be going down due to people not requiring to travel to office or work. These days they may be opting for personal vehicles or other mode of transportation resulting dip in the bike rental.

3. Seasonal Influence: The bike rental seems going up during the spring and fall indicating that these two seasons are favorable for cycling. This is due to more pleasant conditions prompting people to use bikes.

5. Monthly Trends: The bike rentals seems to increase during the months of August and Sept due to good weather onditions. This period may also coincide with start of many education institutions or end of holidays.

Overall, the bike provider company should consider the above analysis and take measures to increase bike rental. During the holidays and bad weather conditions they can reduce rental or offer promotions to encourage more bike usage. And also during fall and spring seasons and months of 3rd and 4th Qtr they should arrange more bikes considering the higher demand for bikes.
